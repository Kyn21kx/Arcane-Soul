THE MILL HOUSE
by Ufuk Orbey (shadedancer619)
Made in: Cinema 4 D R16
--------------------------------------
High quality mill house model for any purpose.

26 objects (all structure)
59358 polygons
118900 edges
60575 points

Just locate the mill in any place you want and rotate it:) It needs some water. You may use it with realflow maybe!

Textures are ok for C4D format but baked textures are perfectly fit to all other formats.
Just find and define them to the correct objects.

See you...
